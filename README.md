# Analysis of School District Test Score Data

## Overview of Project
This project performs a brief comparative analysis of schools within a school district, including comparisons of school population, test scores, and more. The project also demonstrates knowledge of cleaning and prepping data for analysis as we had to clear the initial data set of null and duplicate values.

## Summary of findings
We would need to dive a little deeper into the data with further comparisons to be able to illuminate some more concrete discoveries, but the last few snippets of analysis in this assignment do provide a compelling direction for further investigation. The comparison of the average school budget for charter and public schools reveals that public schools tend to have a larger budget than charter schools. A logical hypothesis might be to assume that a larger school budget would result in higher test scores. However, looking at the average math scores per grade it appears that Charter schools have the higher scores in 9th, 10th, and 11th grade. It would be interesting to continue exploring this research question by comparing the reading scores of both school types, and even drilling down to see if there is a correlation between budget and test scores within the school types themselves.
